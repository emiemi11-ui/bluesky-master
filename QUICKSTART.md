## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always keep reserves** - Don't commit all units at once
2. **Use terrain** - Hills give defensive bonus
3. **Combined arms** - Mix infantry + armor for best results
4. **Watch ammunition** - Units with 0% ammo can't fight!
5. **Morale matters** - Low morale = weak combat power
6. **Flanking wins** - Attack from sides/rear for bonus damage
